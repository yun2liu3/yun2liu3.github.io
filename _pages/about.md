Hello! I’m **Yun Liu**, a Zorn Postdoctoral Fellow at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://math.indiana.edu/index.html). My mentor is [Ajay Ramadoss](https://math.indiana.edu/about/faculty/ramadoss-ajay.html). I received my Ph.D in Mathematics (2023) and M.S. in Computer Science (2018) from [Cornell University](https://math.cornell.edu/), under the supervision of [Yuri Berest](https://math.cornell.edu/yuri-berest).

My research focuses on the intersection between homotopy theory, category theory and representation theory. I am interested in equivariant cohomology theory for compact Lie groups, in particular GKM spaces. I am also working on trace methods of combinatorial K-theory, Quillen’s model category, and models of infinity-categories.

Lately I've been teaching Intuitive Topology and Exploring Mathematical Ideas, two courses that have been as fun as (I hope) for my students! 

I am coordinating outreach programs for the AWM chapter at Indiana University Bloomington, including Math Circle, Julia Robinson Festival, Science Fest, and Sonia Kovalevsky Days. 

Here is my [CV](../files/LiuYun25CV.pdf).
