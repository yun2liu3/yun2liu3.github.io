Hello! I’m **Yun Liu**, a Zorn Postdoctoral Fellow at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://math.indiana.edu/index.html). My mentor is [Ajay Ramadoss](https://math.indiana.edu/about/faculty/ramadoss-ajay.html). I received my Ph.D in Mathematics (2023) and M.S. in Computer Science (2018) from [Cornell University](https://math.cornell.edu/), under the supervision of [Yuri Berest](https://math.cornell.edu/yuri-berest).

My research focuses on the intersection between homotopy theory, category theory and representation theory. I spent a considerable amount of time studying generalized equivariant cohomology of spaces equipped with compact Lie group actions. 
Recently, I have been working on [GKM](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002220050197) spaces (in particular flag manifolds) and their relation with the algebras of quasi-invariants. 

A question that currently interests me is how to describe an explicit CW structure on flag manifolds (explicit in the sense of specifying the attaching maps). If you happen to know more about this problem, or also interested in it,  I would love to discuss it!

I am also interested in category theory and homotopy theory, especially the construction of model category structure and the explicit computation of homotopy (co)limits. I am developing a model category structure on categorified relative Hopf modules, which extends ideas from dg-categories and dg-functors.

Beyond the above topics, I'm curious about functor homology, especially Hochschild homology and cyclic homology, and their generalizations for crossed simplicial groups. I have been thinking about cyclic nerves in the context of combinatorial $K$-theory, especially for polytopes and finite sets.

Lately I've been teaching Intuitive Topology and Exploring Mathematical Ideas, two courses that have been as fun as (I hope) for my students!
